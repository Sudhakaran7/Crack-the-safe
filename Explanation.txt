so he want to open that locker, so that he could get information about the murder, the person have left the clue like,
The password is a sequence of n digits where each digit can be one of the first k digits 0, 1, ..., k-1.
While entering a password, the last n digits entered will automatically be matched against the correct password.
For example, assuming the correct password is "345", if you type "012345", the box will open because the correct password matches the suffix of the entered password.
Find the minimum length that is guaranteed to open the locker.

Input description:
n and k as integers, where n denotes the range of numbers and k denoted the digits of permutation

Output Description:
the minimum length that is guaranteed to open the locker

Sample Input:
1 2

Sample Output:
10
(01 also accepted too., ie all the permutation of the output can be accepted)

Explanined:
the range of number is 1, natural number starts with 0, so the permutation of 0 and 1 is the answer

Sample Input:
2 3

Sample Output:
0221120100

Sample Input:
4 3

Sample Output:
000222212122112111122201220212011202022101210211011102010102200120021001100200010000

Sample Input:
